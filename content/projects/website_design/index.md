I developed a fully custom website for **Will's Remodeling**, focusing on creating a modern, responsive, and high-performance online presence. This project involved close collaboration with the client to meet their specific qualifications and deliver a product that perfectly matched their vision.

## Project Goals

The primary goal was to create a professional portfolio and increase online presence for a local remodeling company to build trust between the company and potential clients. Key requirements included:

- A clean, modern, and user-friendly design.
- Full responsiveness for optimal viewing on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- Fast load times and a high-performance score.
- Strong **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)** to improve online visibility.

## Technical Implementation & Features

The website was built from the ground up using core web technologies to ensure maximum control and performance.

- **Structure and Styling:** The site was built with semantic **HTML5** and styled with **CSS3**, employing modern techniques like Flexbox and Grid for layout.

- **Interactivity:** **JavaScript** was used to implement an image gallery, interactive menu, dynamic transitions and, organization of photos.

- **Performance Optimization:** To ensure fast loading speeds, I implemented several optimizations. A key strategy was the use of next-gen image formats, converting all images to **WebP** to significantly reduce file sizes without sacrificing quality.

- **SEO:** A strong emphasis was placed on SEO from the beginning. This included:
    -   Implementing a clear and logical site structure.
    -   Using semantic HTML tags to help search engines understand the content.
    -   Crafting descriptive meta titles and descriptions for each page.
    -   Ensuring all images had appropriate `alt` text for accessibility and SEO.

The final website successfully met all of the client's requirements. The focus on performance and SEO resulted in a high Google Lighthouse score, particularly in the performance and SEO categories. The client was extremely pleased with the final product, which now serves as their primary online platform.
